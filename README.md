# MyAnimeList Sync - Discord Rich Presence Tutorial
A simple tutorial on how to sync your MyAnimeList account while watching anime online and also display your live watching status on Discord.

### Prerequisites
You should have an account on [MyAnimeList.net](https://myanimelist.net/) and have [Discord](app.com) installed.

While logged into Discord, please ensure that you have enabled your Activity Status.
To do this, click on the gear icon to open the Settings menu and navigate to Activity Privacy > Display current activity as a status message.
Turn this option on.
